# DELETION CANDIDATES - Safe to Remove

Based on activity analysis and duplication:

## HIGH CONFIDENCE DELETIONS

### 1. Duplicate Client Apps (Keep: apps/client - most active, has both builds)
REMOVE:
- apps/client-mobile (119 files, has builds but less active than apps/client)
- apps/mobile (110 files, only Android build)
- apps/sacco-plus-client (15 files, no builds, minimal activity)

### 2. Duplicate Staff Apps (Keep: apps/admin - 1507 files, most active, production app)
REMOVE:
- apps/staff (21 files, no builds, minimal activity)
- apps/staff-admin-pwa (110 files, no builds)

### 3. Stub/Experimental Apps
REMOVE:
- apps/android-auth (17 files, no builds, likely experimental)
- apps/ios (28 files, no builds, likely experimental)
- apps/staff-mobile-android (11 files, no builds, superseded by apps/admin/android)

### 4. Minimal Activity Apps
REMOVE:
- apps/platform-api (33 files, no builds, version 0.0.0, stub for future)

## RATIONALE

KEEP:
- apps/admin (1507 modified files, .next + Android, v0.1.2, production)
- apps/client (359 modified files, .next + Android + iOS, active development)
- apps/website (114 modified files, .next, marketing site)

REMOVE: 7 apps total
- 3 duplicate client variants
- 2 duplicate staff variants  
- 2 experimental platform-specific stubs
- 1 future/stub API

ESTIMATED SAVINGS: ~800MB, ~30K LOC, ~40% of apps
