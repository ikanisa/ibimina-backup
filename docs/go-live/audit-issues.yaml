  risk: critical
  evidence: "AuthX verification loop lacks throttling and never persists last_mfa_step/failed_mfa_count, so attackers can brute-force or replay TOTP/backup codes."
  fix: "Add per-user/IP rate limits, persist step counters + failure counts, align with legacy legacy /api/mfa/verify (removed) semantics, and emit structured errors."
  status: resolved
  resolution: "/api/authx/challenge/verify now enforces per-user and per-IP throttles, audits failures, and keeps Supabase MFA counters in sync with legacy routes."
